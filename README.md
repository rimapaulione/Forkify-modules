# Forkify project

<p> Forkify is a simple recipe finding web application which uses data from the <a href="https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2">Forkify API</a>. It can be used as a guide to cook one's favorite dish. Beyond accessing recipes from different sources online, it also provides information on the number and amount of ingredients needed to build a specific dish according to the number of people to serve. Also you can add your own recipy.</p>
